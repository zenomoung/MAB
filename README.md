Multi Armed Bandit Glouton algorithm "Reinforcement learning" in Java

The Multi Armed Bandit Algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm in artificial intelligence for self learning agent.
The idea is that the agent always chooses what has provent to work: The exploitation vs exploration dilemma.

In its simplest form this algorithm promotes exploitation. 
But it is possible to motivate the agent to explore if we change the value of the init "the first average".
The more this value is high, the more the agent will explore.
